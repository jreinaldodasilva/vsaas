# 🔎 Prompt: Comprehensive Forms, Validation & User Input Audit — VSAAS Frontend

You are a **Senior Frontend Architect and UX Systems Auditor specializing in form architecture, validation systems, accessibility, and data-entry optimization**.

Your task is to perform a **comprehensive audit of all forms, input components, validation strategies, and data-entry UX patterns** in the VSAAS frontend.

The objective is to:

* Document the complete form ecosystem
* Evaluate technical validation correctness
* Assess accessibility and localization (Portuguese)
* Analyze desktop and mobile data-entry UX
* Identify usability bottlenecks and data-risk patterns
* Provide high-level architectural and UX improvement themes

This document should serve as a **long-term technical and UX reference** to support:

* Onboarding
* Refactoring
* Design system evolution
* Product usability improvements

---

# 📚 Available Context & Required Inputs

You have **full read-only access to the frontend repository**.

You must analyze:

* All form pages and modal forms
* All reusable input components
* Validation schemas and utilities
* Custom form hooks
* Styling files impacting forms
* Mobile/responsive styling rules

# 🎯 Deliverable

Generate a single Markdown document with the exact file path:

```
docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Forms-Validation-Overview-Part1.md
docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Forms-Validation-Overview-Part2.md
```

---

# ⚙️ Analytical Standards

When performing the audit:

* Base conclusions strictly on observable code.

* Distinguish between:

  * Technical correctness
  * UX quality
  * Accessibility compliance

* Evaluate both:

  * Happy paths
  * Error and edge cases

* Prefer measurable findings (field counts, LOC, validation rule density).

* Clearly separate facts from interpretation.

* Mark unverifiable assumptions as:

  > *“Not inferable from repository structure.”*

* Do NOT provide step-by-step implementation instructions.

* Provide high-level, strategic recommendations only.

---

# 🚨 Severity Classification

Use consistently:

* 🟥 **Critical** – Prevents task completion or risks incorrect data submission
* 🟧 **High** – Strong UX friction or accessibility barrier
* 🟨 **Medium** – Clarity, consistency, or efficiency issue
* 🟩 **Low** – Optimization or UX polish opportunity

---

# 📦 Scope of Analysis

---

---

## Observations

Include:

* Form architecture maturity

# 2️⃣ Input Component Library Audit

Catalog all reusable input and form-related components from:

```
src/components/
```

Cross-reference with Component Library documentation.

---

## Required Table

Classify accessibility:

* 🟥 Major accessibility gaps
* 🟧 Partial compliance
* 🟩 Good compliance

---

# 3️⃣ Critical Forms Deep Dive (3–5 Key Forms)

Select 3–5 high-impact forms such as:

* Camera registration

* Multi-step logic
* Cross-role variation

---

## For Each Form Include:

### Metadata

* Target role(s)
* Business objective
* Entry route
* Exit route
* Approximate LOC

---

### Field Breakdown

Group fields logically and document:

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Validation | Conditional? |

Include:

* Input optimization for mobile (inputMode, type)
* Derived fields

---

### Validation Review

Analyze:

* Library used (Yup, Zod, custom, etc.)
* Schema reuse
* Cross-field validation
* Async validation
* Trigger timing (onChange, onBlur, onSubmit)
* Server error mapping

---

### UX Evaluation

Assess:

* Cognitive load
* Field grouping logic
* Visual hierarchy
* Placeholder clarity
* Inline guidance
* Error recovery flow
* Submission feedback timing

Use structured indicators:

* ✅ Strength
* ⚠️ Friction
* ❌ Blocking issue

---

### Mobile Experience Review

Evaluate:

* Responsive layout behavior
* Keyboard type optimization
* Scroll and focus management
* Touch target sizes
* Sticky buttons or fixed CTAs
* Autofill support

Classify mobile usability issues using severity indicators.

---

# 4️⃣ Validation Architecture & Pattern Analysis

Document the overall validation ecosystem.

Analyze:

* Validation library usage
* Centralized vs scattered schemas
* Schema reuse consistency
* Duplication of validation logic
* Field-level vs form-level validation
* Server validation integration
* Error normalization layer (if present)

---

## Message Quality Review (Portuguese)

Evaluate validation messages for:

* Localization completeness
* Language consistency
* Tone (professional vs technical)
* Actionability
