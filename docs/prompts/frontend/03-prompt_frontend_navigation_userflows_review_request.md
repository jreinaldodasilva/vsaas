# 🔎 Prompt: Comprehensive Routing, Navigation & User Flow Audit — VSAAS Frontend

You are a **Senior Frontend Architect specializing in routing architecture, access control systems, and user flow modeling**.

Your task is to perform a **comprehensive audit of the VSAAS frontend routing and navigation architecture**, including:

* Route hierarchy and composition
* Route protection and authorization logic
* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Navigation UI implementation
* Conditional rendering patterns
* End-to-end user journey modeling
* Architectural and UX risk identification

The objective is to produce a **clear, structured, long-term technical reference document** that:

* Documents routing and authorization behavior
* Models real user journeys
* Identifies security and UX risks
* Supports onboarding
* Informs architectural evolution

---

# 📚 Available Context & Required Inputs

You have **full read-only access to the frontend repository**.

You must analyze:

* All routing configuration files
* React Router setup and route definitions
* `main.tsx`, `App.tsx`, or router bootstrap files
* Authentication utilities
* Authorization helpers
* Protected route components
* Role/permission configuration files (if present)
* Navigation components (sidebar, header, menus, breadcrumbs, mobile nav)
* Pages and feature modules referenced by routes

---

# 🎯 Deliverable

Generate a single Markdown document with the exact file path:

```
docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-Navigation-UserFlows-Overview-Part1.md
docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-Navigation-UserFlows-Overview-Part2.md
```

---

# ⚙️ Analytical Standards

When performing the audit:

* Base conclusions strictly on observable code.

* Use static analysis and import tracing for route relationships.

* Distinguish clearly between:

  * Routing structure
  * Authorization logic
  * Navigation UI implementation

* Prefer measurable findings over subjective commentary.

* Separate facts from interpretation.

* Mark unverifiable assumptions as:

  > *“Not inferable from repository structure.”*

* Do NOT provide implementation-level rewrite instructions.

* Provide high-level, strategic recommendations only.

---

# 🚨 Severity Classification

Use the following consistently:

* 🟥 **Critical** – Security or authorization risk
* 🟧 **High** – UX or maintainability risk
* 🟨 **Medium** – Structural inconsistency or complexity concern
* 🟩 **Low** – Optimization opportunity

---

# 📦 Scope of Analysis

---

# 1️⃣ Routing Architecture Documentation

Identify and document the **complete route hierarchy**.

Include:

* Static routes
* Nested routes
* Layout wrappers
* Lazy-loaded routes
* Dynamic routes (`:id`, etc.)
* Route grouping by role or feature
* Index routes
* Fallback / 404 routes
* Redirect rules

---

## Required Route Tree Output

Produce a structured tree representation such as:

```
/
├── /login
├── /forgot-password
├── /dashboard
│   ├── /super-admin
│   ├── /admin
│   ├── /operator
│   ├── /staff
│   └── /camera
└── ...
```

Reflect actual implementation (including layout nesting).

## Route Metrics

Provide measurable data:

| Metric                 | Count | Notes |
| ---------------------- | ----- | ----- |
| Total routes           |       |       |
| Public routes          |       |       |
| Protected routes       |       |       |
| Role-restricted routes |       |       |
| Dynamic routes         |       |       |
| Lazy-loaded routes     |       |       |
| Layout wrappers        |       |       |

## Route Classification Table

| Path | Component | Public/Protected | Roles | Lazy? | Layout | Notes |

# 2️⃣ Protected Route & Authorization Architecture

Analyze how route protection is implemented.

Evaluate:

* Authentication detection mechanism
* Role resolution logic
* Permission evaluation strategy
* Authorization enforcement location (router vs wrapper vs component-level)
* Redirect logic for:

  * Unauthenticated users
  * Unauthorized users
* Error handling and fallback behavior

---

## Authorization Flow Documentation

Document:

* Token validation flow
* Session expiration handling
* Coupling between authentication state and routing
* Dependency on Zustand or Query state
* Potential bypass risks

If pattern resembles:

```tsx
<ProtectedRoute allowedRoles={['admin']}>
  <Dashboard />
</ProtectedRoute>
```

Document exact implementation logic and limitations.

# 3️⃣ Permission Matrix

Create a complete access matrix across user roles.

Identify:

* Route access by role
* Feature/module access by role
* UI visibility differences
* Conditional rendering patterns

---

## Required Matrix Format

| Route / Feature | Super Admin | Admin | Operator | Staff | Camera | Notes |
| --------------- | ----------- | ----- | -------- | ----- | ------- | ----- |

If role definitions are not explicit, infer only from observable code.

---

## Additional Observations

* Role granularity level
* Hardcoded vs configuration-based permissions
* Scalability of RBAC design
* Inconsistent access enforcement
