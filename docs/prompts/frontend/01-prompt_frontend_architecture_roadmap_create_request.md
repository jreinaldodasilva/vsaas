Excellent — here is the **frontend-equivalent version** of your backend architecture-scoped prompt, aligned in structure, rigor, and clarity.

This version is tailored specifically for:

# PROMPT (Architecture-Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Frontend Architecture Improvement Roadmap

**Source Document:** `docs/frontend/01-VSAAS-Frontend-Architecture-Overview.md`
**Scope Restriction:** Architecture document only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic frontend architecture improvement roadmap strictly from the Frontend Architecture Overview document**.

You must:

* Use only findings, gaps, risks, and recommendations explicitly described in
  `docs/frontend/01-VSAAS-Frontend-Architecture-Overview.md`
* Not reference any other frontend documents
* Not assume issues from UX audits, accessibility audits, performance audits, or testing strategy documents
* Not invent technical debt outside what is implied in the architecture review
* Clearly reference relevant architecture sections

This is an **architecture-focused roadmap**, not a full frontend product roadmap.

---

# Objective

Transform the architectural findings into:

1. Prioritized architectural risks
2. Structural improvement plan
3. Architecture-only technical debt estimate
4. Phased implementation roadmap
5. Frontend architecture maturity score
6. Executive summary for CTO-level audience

---

# 1. Frontend Architecture Issue Extraction

Extract every issue related to:

* Application structure & folder organization
* Layer separation (UI / domain / services / state)
* Component architecture
* State management strategy
* Routing architecture
* Module boundaries
* Shared component design
* Dependency management
* Environment configuration handling
* Build tooling & bundling structure
* Code splitting strategy (if mentioned)
* Error boundaries & resilience patterns
* Performance architecture decisions
* Security practices at frontend level
* Observability/logging integration (frontend scope)
* Scalability readiness
* Micro-frontend strategy (if applicable)
* API consumption architecture (structure only, not API quality)

## Deliverable:

Architecture-scoped quick wins with actionable implementation guidance.

| Category | Description | Risk if Ignored | Effort Estimate | Priority | Source Section |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------- | -------------- |

Provide:

* Total estimated developer-days
* Confidence level (Low / Medium / High)
* Assumptions (if any)

---

# 4. Phased Frontend Architecture Roadmap

Design an execution roadmap focused strictly on structural frontend improvements.

Assume:

* 3–5 frontend engineers
* 2-week sprints
* Parallel work allowed when boundaries permit

---

## Phase 1 – Stabilization (Weeks 1–2)

Focus:

* Critical architectural risks
* Global state instability
* Deployment/build fragility
* Major coupling risks

---

## Phase 2 – Structural Hardening (Weeks 3–6)

Focus:

* Layer separation enforcement
* Component boundary cleanup
* State architecture refactor
* Configuration isolation
* Observability improvements

---

## Phase 3 – Scalability & Performance (Weeks 7–10)

Focus:

* Code splitting readiness
* Lazy loading improvements
* Bundle structure optimization
* Performance architecture enforcement
* Resilience patterns

---

## Phase 4 – Architecture Maturity (Weeks 11–14)

Focus:

* Modularization improvements
* Shared component architecture
* Future-proofing patterns
* Strategic modernization

---

Each phase must include:

* Goal
* Included issues (by ID)
* Total effort estimate
* Dependencies
* Business impact

---

# 5. Frontend Architecture KPIs & Success Metrics

Define architecture-relevant metrics only.

Examples (only if aligned with document findings):

| Metric                    | Current State | Target                | Measurement Method  |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Component coupling index  | ?             | -40%                  | Dependency analysis |
| Global state surface area | ?             | Reduced by 50%        | State audit         |
| Bundle modularization     | ?             | Lazy-loaded routes    | Bundle analyzer     |
| Build time                | ?             | -30%                  | CI metrics          |
| Error boundary coverage   | ?             | 100% top-level routes | Code audit          |
| Circular dependencies     | ?             | 0                     | Static analysis     |

Do NOT include UX, design, or accessibility metrics unless architecture document discusses them structurally.
