Excellent — below is the **forms & validation–scoped equivalent** of your previous structured prompts, tailored specifically for:

* `docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Forms-Validation-Overview-Part1.md`
* `docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Forms-Validation-Overview-Part2.md`

This version:

* Strictly isolates scope to forms and validation architecture
* Avoids cross-contamination with state, component, or backend audits
* Converts documented gaps into an execution roadmap
* Maintains CTO-level structure and traceability
* Focuses on systemic form reliability, validation consistency, and data integrity

# PROMPT (Forms & Validation–Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Frontend Forms & Validation Improvement Roadmap

**Source Documents:**

* `docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Forms-Validation-Overview-Part1.md`
* `docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Forms-Validation-Overview-Part2.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Forms and Validation documentation only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Forms & Validation documentation**.

You must:

* Use only findings, risks, inconsistencies, gaps, and recommendations explicitly described in Part1–Part3
* Not reference any other frontend documents
* Not assume issues from backend validation, API contracts, accessibility audits, or component architecture unless explicitly mentioned
* Not invent technical debt outside what is implied in these documents
* Clearly reference the relevant Part (Part1, Part2, or Part3)

This is a **forms & validation-focused roadmap**, not a full frontend roadmap.

---

1. Prioritized forms & validation risks
2. Form reliability and standardization plan
3. Validation-related technical debt estimate
4. Phased improvement roadmap
5. Forms maturity score
