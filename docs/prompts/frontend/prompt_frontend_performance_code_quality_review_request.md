## VSAAS Frontend – Performance, Code Quality, and Security Audit

Conduct a **comprehensive frontend technical audit** of the VSAAS application.

You must analyze:

* Application performance
* Core Web Vitals
* Bundle size and dependency impact
* Code quality and architecture
* TypeScript usage maturity
* React patterns and anti-patterns
* Error handling robustness
* Security practices (including LGPD considerations)
* Testing coverage and reliability

In addition to the source code and build artifacts, you must also read and use the architectural context provided in:

* `docs/frontend/01-VSAAS-Frontend-Architecture-Overview.md`

Use this document to validate whether the implementation aligns with the intended architecture and frontend standards.

---

# 🔎 Required Materials

You have access to:

* Complete frontend source code
* Production build output
* Bundle analyzer results
* Chrome DevTools (Performance, Lighthouse, Network, Coverage)
* React DevTools Profiler
* Testing framework files (if present)
* `docs/frontend/01-VSAAS-Frontend-Architecture-Overview.md`

---

# 📋 Audit Scope & Tasks

---

## 1️⃣ Performance Analysis

### Lighthouse Audits

Run Lighthouse on all key pages (minimum: Login, Dashboard, Camera List, Recordings).

Report results:

| Page  | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO   |
| ----- | ----------- | ------------- | -------------- | ----- |
| Login | ?/100       | ?/100         | ?/100          | ?/100 |

Include:

* Major blocking resources
* Render-blocking scripts
* Large layout shifts
* Third-party performance impact

---

### Core Web Vitals

Measure:

* LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)
* FID (First Input Delay)
* CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)

| Page  | LCP | FID | CLS | Pass/Fail |
| ----- | --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| Login | ?s  | ?ms | ?   | ?         |

Assess:

* Real vs lab data differences (if available)
* Mobile vs desktop performance
* Causes of failures

---

### Bundle & Dependency Analysis

Provide:

```
Total bundle size: ??? KB (gzipped)
Initial load JS: ??? KB
Largest route chunk: ??? KB
```

Identify:

Largest dependencies:

1. [package] — ??? KB
2. [package] — ??? KB

Largest internal modules:

1. [file] — ??? KB
2. [file] — ??? KB

Assess:

* Tree-shaking effectiveness
* Dead code
* Dynamic imports usage
* Code splitting strategy

---

### React DevTools Profiling

Identify:

* Components with excessive re-renders
* Expensive renders (>16ms)
* Inefficient memoization
* State colocations issues

Deliver insights with concrete examples.

---

### ✅ Deliverable

A **Complete Performance Audit Report** with severity classification:

* 🟥 Critical
* 🟧 High
* 🟨 Medium
* 🟩 Low

---

## 2️⃣ Code Quality Analysis

Evaluate overall maintainability and architectural alignment.

---

### TypeScript Usage

Assess:

* Strict mode: Enabled / Disabled
* `any` usage count
* Unsafe type assertions
* Type coverage estimate (%)
* Missing type definitions
* Usage of generics
* Domain type modeling quality

Provide:

| Metric        | Value |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Strict Mode   | ?     |
| any Count     | ?     |
| Type Coverage | ?%    |

---

### React Patterns Audit

#### ✅ Good Practices Found

* Functional components

#### ❌ Anti-Patterns Found

| Anti-Pattern                | Count | Examples   | Priority    |
| --------------------------- | ----- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Large components (>300 LOC) | ?     | [List]     | 🟧 High     |
| Props drilling (>3 levels)  | ?     | [Examples] | 🟧 High     |
| Missing useEffect deps      | ?     | [Examples] | 🟥 Critical |
| Business logic inside UI    | ?     | [Examples] | 🟧 High     |

---

### Code Organization

* File size distribution
* Duplication patterns
* Naming conventions
* Architecture alignment with `01-VSAAS-Frontend-Architecture-Overview.md`

---

### ✅ Deliverable

A **Code Quality Report** with measurable findings and refactoring priorities.

---

## 3️⃣ Error Handling Analysis

Document:

* Error boundaries implementation
* API error handling consistency
* Centralized vs scattered handling
* Retry strategies
* User-facing error messaging clarity
* Error logging/monitoring integration (Sentry, etc.)

Classify findings:

* 🟥 Unhandled errors
* 🟧 Inconsistent patterns
* 🟨 Poor UX error messaging
* 🟩 Missing monitoring

---

### ✅ Deliverable
