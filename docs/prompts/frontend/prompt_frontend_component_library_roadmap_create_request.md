# PROMPT (Component Library–Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Component Library Improvement Roadmap

**Source Documents:**

* `docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Component-Library-Part1.md`
* `docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Component-Library-Part2.md`
* `docs/frontend/02-VSAAS-Component-Library-Part3.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Component Library documentation only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Component Library documentation**.

You must:

* Use only findings, gaps, inconsistencies, risks, and recommendations explicitly described in the three Part1–Part3 documents
* Not reference any other frontend documents
* Not assume issues from architecture, UX audit, accessibility audit, or performance documents
* Not invent design system debt outside what is implied in these documents
* Clearly reference the relevant Part (Part1, Part2, or Part3)

This is a **component-library-focused roadmap**, not a full frontend or product roadmap.

---

# Objective

Transform documented findings into:

1. Prioritized component system issues
2. Design system hardening plan
3. Component-level technical debt estimate
4. Phased improvement roadmap
5. Component library maturity score
6. Executive summary for leadership

---

# 1. Component Library Issue Extraction

* 2-week sprints
* Parallel component refactoring allowed

---

## Phase 1 – Stabilization (Weeks 1–2)

* Critical duplication
* Core component instability

---

## Phase 2 – Standardization (Weeks 3–6)

Focus:

# 5. Component Library KPIs & Success Metrics

Define metrics strictly relevant to component system quality.

Examples (only if supported by documents):

| --------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Component duplication ratio | ?             | -50%                                | Static analysis     |
| Variant consistency         | ?             | Standardized APIs                   | Component audit     |
