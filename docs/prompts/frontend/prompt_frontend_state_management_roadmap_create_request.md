# PROMPT (State-Management–Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Frontend State Management Improvement Roadmap

**Source Documents:**

* `docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-State-Management-Part1.md`
* `docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-State-Management-Part2.md`
* `docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-State-Management-Part3.md`

**Scope Restriction:** State Management documentation only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Frontend State Management documentation**.

You must:

* Use only findings, risks, gaps, and recommendations explicitly described in Part1–Part3
* Not reference any other frontend documents
* Not assume issues from architecture, component library, performance audits, or backend documentation
* Not invent state-related technical debt outside what is implied in these documents
* Clearly reference the relevant Part (Part1, Part2, or Part3)

This is a **state-management-focused roadmap**, not a full frontend or product roadmap.

---

# Objective

1. Prioritized state architecture risks
2. State stabilization & refactoring plan
3. State-management technical debt estimate
4. Phased implementation roadmap
5. State architecture maturity score
6. Executive summary for CTO-level audience

| ----------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | --------------- |
| Global store size             | ?             | Reduced by 40%   | Store audit     |
| Duplicate state slices        | ?             | 0                | Code analysis   |
