Excellent — below is the **navigation & user-flow–scoped equivalent** of your previous prompts, tailored specifically for:

* `docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-Navigation-UserFlows-Overview-Part1.md`
* `docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-Navigation-UserFlows-Overview-Part2.md`

This version:

* Strictly isolates scope to navigation and flow architecture
* Avoids UX audit contamination unless explicitly documented
* Converts documented flow gaps into an execution roadmap
* Maintains CTO-level structure and traceability
* Focuses on systemic navigation integrity and flow reliability

# PROMPT (Navigation & User-Flows–Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Frontend Navigation & User Flow Improvement Roadmap

**Source Documents:**

* `docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-Navigation-UserFlows-Overview-Part1.md`
* `docs/frontend/03-VSAAS-Navigation-UserFlows-Overview-Part2.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Navigation and User Flow documentation only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Navigation & User Flow documentation**.

You must:

* Use only findings, risks, gaps, inconsistencies, and recommendations explicitly described in Part1–Part2
* Not reference any other frontend documents
* Not assume issues from architecture, state management, accessibility audits, or performance documents
* Not invent navigation or UX problems not supported by these documents
* Clearly reference the relevant Part (Part1 or Part2)

This is a **navigation and flow-focused roadmap**, not a full UX or frontend roadmap.

1. Prioritized navigation & flow risks
2. Structural flow stabilization plan
3. Navigation-related technical debt estimate
4. Phased improvement roadmap
5. Navigation maturity score
