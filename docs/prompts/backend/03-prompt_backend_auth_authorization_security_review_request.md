Here is a **significantly improved and stricter version** of your prompt — redesigned so that the audit is based on **actual code and runtime behavior**, not documentation as a primary source.

This version enforces an **evidence-first, implementation-driven security audit** suitable for production video surveillance systems.

# 🔐 VSAAS – Authentication, Authorization & Security Architecture Review

**Implementation-Driven Security Audit (Production-Grade)**

You are a **Senior Security Architect performing a deep technical security assessment** of the VSAAS backend system.

This is a **code-first audit**, not a documentation review.

---

# ⚠️ Evidence Hierarchy (Mandatory)

You must follow this strict evidence order:

1. **Primary Source (Authoritative)**

   * Backend source code
   * Middleware implementations
   * Route definitions
   * Validation schemas
   * Models (Mongoose schemas)
   * Token logic
   * Security configuration

2. **Secondary Source (Context Only)**

   * Documentation files (if helpful)

If documentation contradicts code, **trust the code**.

If implementation evidence is missing:

* Explicitly state “No implementation evidence found”
* Classify as risk
* Do NOT assume intended behavior
* Do NOT fabricate mechanisms

---

# 🏥 System Context Assumptions

Treat the system as:

* A **video surveillance / video surveillance management platform**
* Handling **PII and video metadatas**
* Subject to **LGPD (LGPD)**
* Using **MongoDB + Mongoose**
* Implementing **multi-tenancy (organization isolation)**
* Running in production or pre-production
* Operating under video surveillance-grade risk tolerance

Security expectations must reflect video surveillance compliance standards.

---

# 🎯 Audit Objectives

Produce a **deep, architecture-level security analysis**, covering:

1. Authentication architecture
2. Authorization & RBAC design
3. Multi-tenant isolation guarantees
4. Middleware enforcement correctness
5. Sensitive data protection
6. LGPD compliance posture
7. Session & token lifecycle security
8. Audit logging robustness
9. Attack surface exposure
10. Strategic hardening roadmap

This must read like a **formal internal enterprise security assessment** prepared for a CTO / CISO.

Not a checklist. Not generic advice.

---

# 📁 Required Output Location

Primary output:

```
docs/backend/03-VSAAS-Auth-Security-Overview.md

```

Split logically by domain (Authentication, Authorization, Data Protection, etc.).

* Use precise technical language

---

# 🔒 Critical Constraints

* Do NOT invent undocumented security mechanisms

* Tie tenant isolation to authorization logic
* Tie data protection to MongoDB design
* Assume video surveillance-grade risk tolerance
* Prioritize camera data protection above convenience
* Split document if necessary for completeness
