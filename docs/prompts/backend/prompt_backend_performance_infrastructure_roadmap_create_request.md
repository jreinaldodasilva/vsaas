# VSAAS – Performance & Infrastructure Improvement Roadmap

**Source Documents:**

* `docs/backend/11-VSAAS-Performance-Infrastructure-Part1.md`
* `docs/backend/11-VSAAS-Performance-Infrastructure-Part2.md`
* `docs/backend/11-VSAAS-Performance-Infrastructure-Part3.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Performance & Infrastructure documents only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Performance & Infrastructure documentation**.

You must:

* Use only findings, bottlenecks, risks, weaknesses, and recommendations explicitly described in the three Performance & Infrastructure documents
* Treat Part1, Part2, and Part3 as a single consolidated source of truth
* Not reference API, MongoDB, Auth, Business Logic, or Integration documents unless directly cited inside these files
* Not invent performance issues that are not described or clearly implied
* Clearly reference the relevant section and document part for every major issue

This is a **performance & infrastructure-focused roadmap**, not a backend-wide roadmap.

---

# Objective

1. Prioritized performance risks
2. Infrastructure hardening plan
3. Performance technical debt estimate
4. Phased infrastructure roadmap
