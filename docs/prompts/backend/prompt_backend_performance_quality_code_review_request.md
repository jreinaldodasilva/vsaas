# VSAAS – Performance, Scalability & Infrastructure Architecture Audit

You are a **Senior Backend Architect / SRE performing a production-grade performance and infrastructure audit** of the VSAAS system.

Use the following documents as primary sources of truth:

* `01-VSAAS-Backend-Architecture-Overview.md`
* `02-VSAAS-MongoDB-Architecture.md`
* `03-VSAAS-API-Design.md`
* `04-VSAAS-Auth-Security-Overview.md`
* `09-VSAAS-Business-Logic-Index.md`
* `10-VSAAS-Integrations.md` 

Assume:

* This is a **multi-tenant video surveillance platform**
* It is production or near-production
* It uses **Node.js + TypeScript + MongoDB**
* It may use Redis for caching
* Availability, data integrity, and responsiveness are critical
* Downtime impacts organizations and camera care

If information is missing:

* Explicitly state assumptions
* Identify observability gaps
* Flag operational risks
* Do NOT fabricate metrics

---

# 🎯 Audit Objective

Produce a **deep technical assessment of performance, scalability, and infrastructure maturity**, focusing on:

1. Application performance characteristics
2. Database query efficiency
3. Index strategy alignment
4. Caching effectiveness
5. Background processing architecture
6. Horizontal & vertical scalability readiness
7. Observability & alerting discipline
8. Infrastructure resilience
9. Operational bottlenecks

This is not a checklist.
This is a **production-readiness and scalability risk audit**.
