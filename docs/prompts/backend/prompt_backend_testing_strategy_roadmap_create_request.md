# PROMPT (Testing Strategy-Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Testing Strategy & Quality Assurance Improvement Roadmap

**Source Document:**
`docs/backend/13-VSAAS-Testing-Strategy-Enterprise.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Testing strategy document only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Testing Strategy Enterprise document**.

You must:

* Use only findings, weaknesses, risks, coverage gaps, and recommendations explicitly described in
  `docs/backend/13-VSAAS-Testing-Strategy-Enterprise.md`
* Not reference Architecture, API, MongoDB, Auth, Performance, Code Quality, or Integrations documents unless explicitly cited inside the testing document
* Not invent test gaps that are not documented or clearly implied
* Not assume coverage issues without documentation support
* Clearly reference relevant sections of the testing strategy document for each issue

This is a **testing & QA-focused roadmap**, not a full backend roadmap.

---

# Objective

Transform the testing strategy findings into:

1. Prioritized testing risks
2. QA hardening plan
3. Test-related technical debt estimate
4. Phased testing maturity roadmap
5. QA maturity score
6. Executive summary for CTO-level audience
