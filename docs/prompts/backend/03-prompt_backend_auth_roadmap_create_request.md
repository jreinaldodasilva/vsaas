# PROMPT (Auth & Security-Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Authentication & Security Improvement Roadmap

**Primary Source Document:**
`docs/backend/03-VSAAS-Auth-Security-Overview-Part1.md`
`docs/backend/03-VSAAS-Auth-Security-Overview-Part2.md`

**Scope Rule:**
Use the Auth & Security Overview as the primary source of truth.
Other backend documents may only be used when explicitly referenced inside this document.

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic security and authentication improvement roadmap** based on the Auth & Security Overview document.

You must:

* Use all findings, risks, and recommendations explicitly described in `docs/backend/03-VSAAS-Auth-Security-Overview-Part1.md` and `docs/backend/03-VSAAS-Auth-Security-Overview-Part2.md`
* Follow cross-document references mentioned inside it
* Not assume security issues outside what is stated or referenced
* Not invent vulnerabilities not implied in the documentation
* Clearly trace each issue back to its source section (including referenced documents when applicable)

This is a **security-architecture and authentication roadmap**, not a general backend roadmap.
