# 🔎 PROMPT Backend Code Quality & Testing – Enterprise Production Audit

# VSAAS Backend Code Quality & Testing Review

## Context

You are conducting a **senior-level production architecture audit** of the VSAAS backend.

The system:

* Is a **multi-tenant video surveillance/video surveillance management platform**
* Uses **Node.js + Express + TypeScript**
* Implements **RBAC with 8 roles and 21 permissions**
* Uses **JWT-based dual authentication (staff + camera)**
* Supports **165+ endpoints across 13 domains**
* Handles **sensitive video surveillance and financial data**
* Enforces **organization-scoped isolation**
* Requires **high security, reliability, and auditability**

This is not a basic lint review.
This is a **production-grade codebase maturity assessment**.

If information is missing:

* Explicitly state assumptions
* Highlight architectural risks
* Recommend enterprise-level improvements

  "strictNullChecks": ?,
  "noUnusedLocals": ?,
  "noUnusedParameters": ?
}
```

Flag:

* 🟥 Strict mode disabled

* 🟨 Overuse of type assertions

---

## 3.2 Type Coverage

Measure:

* Explicit `any`
* Implicit `any`

* Enum usage for status values

Deliver:

* Type maturity score (0–100)

# Writing Guidelines

* Be precise and structured
* Use severity classification consistently
* Separate findings from recommendations
* Avoid speculation without stating assumptions
* Write for senior backend engineers and architects
* Think in terms of production risk, not just style
* If necessary due to the size of the document, split the document into more files.
