# PROMPT (Integrations-Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – External Integrations Improvement Roadmap

**Primary Source Documents:**

* `docs/backend/10-VSAAS-Integrations-Part1.md`
* `docs/backend/10-VSAAS-Integrations-Part2.md`
* `docs/backend/10-VSAAS-Integrations-Part3.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Integration documents only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Integrations documentation (Parts 1–3)**.

You must:

* Use only findings, risks, gaps, and recommendations explicitly described in:

  * `10-VSAAS-Integrations-Part1.md`
  * `10-VSAAS-Integrations-Part2.md`
  * `10-VSAAS-Integrations-Part3.md`
* Not reference other backend documents unless explicitly mentioned inside these integration documents
* Not invent integration failures not implied in the documentation
* Clearly trace every issue back to a specific section and part

This is an **external systems integration roadmap**, not a general backend, architecture, or security roadmap.

1. Prioritized integration risks
2. Reliability and resilience improvement plan
3. Integration technical debt estimate
4. Phased integration hardening roadmap
5. Integration maturity score
6. Executive-level summary for CTO / Operations
