# PROMPT (MongoDB-Architecture-Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – MongoDB Architecture Improvement Roadmap

**Source Document:** `docs/backend/02-VSAAS-MongoDB-Architecture.md`
**Scope Restriction:** MongoDB Architecture document only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic database improvement roadmap strictly from the MongoDB Architecture document**.

You must:

* Use only findings, risks, gaps, and recommendations explicitly described in
  `docs/backend/02-VSAAS-MongoDB-Architecture.md`
* Not reference any other backend documents
* Not assume issues from API, testing, security, or backend architecture audits
* Not invent database technical debt outside what is implied in the MongoDB architecture review
* Clearly reference relevant MongoDB architecture sections

This is a **database-architecture-focused roadmap**, not a full backend or infrastructure roadmap.

---

# Objective

Transform the MongoDB architectural findings into:

1. Prioritized database risks
2. Data-architecture improvement plan
3. Database technical debt estimate
4. Phased MongoDB improvement roadmap
5. MongoDB maturity score
6. Executive summary for CTO / Head of Engineering

---

# 1. MongoDB Architecture Issue Extraction

Extract every issue related to:

* Transaction usage
* Atomicity guarantees
* Sharding readiness
* Replica set configuration
* Backup and restore strategy
* Write/read scaling
* Locking and contention risks
* Data integrity constraints
* Soft-delete patterns
* TTL/index lifecycle policies
* Migration/versioning strategy
* Observability of database performance
* Data compliance concerns (if mentioned)

* **Impact**
* **Effort**
* **Implementation Steps**
* **Risk Level**

Target: 5–12 quick wins maximum.

## Deliverable:

MongoDB-scoped quick wins with implementation guidance.

---

# 3. MongoDB Technical Debt Assessment

Break down only database-architecture-related debt.

---

### Categories

* Data modeling debt
* Indexing debt
* Multi-tenant isolation debt
* Query performance debt
* Transaction usage debt
* Aggregation complexity debt
* Scalability readiness debt
* Backup & recovery debt
* Migration/versioning debt
* Observability gaps (query metrics, slow logs)

---

## Debt Table

| Category | Description | Risk if Ignored | Effort Estimate | Priority |
| -------- | ----------- | --------------- | --------------- | -------- |

Provide:

* Total estimated developer-days
* Confidence level (High / Medium / Low)
* Explicit assumptions

---

# 4. Phased MongoDB Improvement Roadmap

Design a roadmap focused purely on database improvements.

---

## Phase 1 – Data Safety & Integrity (Weeks 1–2)

Focus:

* Tenant isolation enforcement
* Unique constraints
* Critical index gaps
* Transaction safeguards
* Corruption or duplication risks

Include only issues labeled high-risk in the MongoDB document.

---

## Phase 2 – Performance Hardening (Weeks 3–6)

Focus:

* Index optimization
* Query plan improvements
* Compound index alignment
* Projection optimization
* Eliminating collection scans
* Aggregation performance tuning

---

## Phase 3 – Scalability & Resilience (Weeks 7–10)

Focus:

* Replica set configuration
* Sharding readiness
* Write scaling
* Read distribution
* Backup automation
* Disaster recovery validation

---

## Phase 4 – Data Architecture Maturity (Weeks 11–14)

Focus:

* Schema evolution strategy
* Migration versioning
* Observability improvements
* Index lifecycle management
* Long-term scalability optimization

---

Each phase must include:

* Goal
* Included issues
* Total effort estimate
* Dependencies
* Business impact

---

# 5. MongoDB KPIs & Success Metrics

Define database-specific metrics only.

Examples:

| Metric                       | Current State | Target                        | Measurement           |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------- |
| Indexed query coverage       | ?             | 100% critical queries indexed | Query plan audit      |
| Avg query latency            | ?             | <50ms                         | Performance profiling |
| Collection scan count        | ?             | 0 on critical paths           | MongoDB profiler      |
| Tenant isolation enforcement | ?             | 100%                          | Query review          |
| Write conflict rate          | ?             | <0.5%                         | Monitoring            |
| Backup success rate          | ?             | 100% automated                | Backup logs           |
| Aggregation runtime (P95)    | ?             | <100ms                        | APM                   |

Do not include non-database KPIs (e.g., test coverage, API consistency).
