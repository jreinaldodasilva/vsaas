# PROMPT (Business-Logic-Scoped Version)

# VSAAS – Business Logic Improvement Roadmap

**Primary Source Document:**
`docs/backend/09-VSAAS-Business-Logic-Index.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Business Logic document only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic business-logic improvement roadmap strictly from the Business Logic Index document**.

You must:

* Use only findings, risks, inconsistencies, and recommendations explicitly described in
  `docs/backend/09-VSAAS-Business-Logic-Index.md`
* Not reference other backend documents unless explicitly referenced inside this document
* Not assume architectural, API, or database issues unless directly tied to business rules
* Not invent domain rules not implied in the document
* Clearly trace each issue back to its source section

This is a **domain logic and rule-consistency roadmap**, not a system architecture roadmap.

---

# Objective

Transform the business logic findings into:

1. Prioritized domain-rule risks
2. Business rule consistency improvement plan
3. Business logic technical debt estimate
4. Phased domain stabilization roadmap
5. Business logic maturity score
6. Executive summary for CTO / Product / Operations leadership

---

# 1. Business Logic Issue Extraction

Extract every issue related to:

### Domain Modeling

* Domain entity boundaries
* Aggregates and invariants
* Responsibility distribution
* Service-layer overreach
* Domain leakage into controllers
* Fat services / anemic models
* Missing domain abstractions

---

### Business Rule Consistency

* Inconsistent rule enforcement
* Missing validation logic
* Duplicated rule logic
* Implicit vs explicit rule definition
* Conditional logic sprawl
* Hardcoded business constraints
* Unclear state transitions
* Undefined lifecycle states

---

### Workflow & Process Logic

---

### Multi-Tenant Business Rules

* Organization-scoped logic enforcement
* Cross-organization rule consistency
* Ownership validation
* Business isolation guarantees

* Refund rules
* Ledger consistency

---

### Data Integrity & Invariants

* Concurrency logic
* Idempotency in workflows

---

### Cross-Domain Coupling

* Hidden dependencies between modules
* Circular logic flows
* Rule entanglement
* High cognitive complexity areas

---

Provide:

* Total estimated developer-days
* Confidence level (High / Medium / Low)
* Explicit assumptions
* Risk severity level (Low / Moderate / High / Critical)

---

# 4. Phased Business Logic Stabilization Roadmap

Design a roadmap focused purely on domain and rule stabilization.

---

## Phase 1 – Critical Rule Stabilization (Weeks 1–2)

Focus:

* Financial inconsistencies
* Invariant violations

* Reducing service-layer complexity
* Introducing value objects
* Improving aggregate boundaries
* Reducing cross-domain entanglement

---

## Phase 4 – Domain Maturity & Optimization (Weeks 11–14)

* Simplifying complex conditionals
* Improving idempotency logic
* Standardizing financial calculations
* Enhancing rule documentation
* Establishing domain governance guidelines

---

Each phase must include:

* Goal

# 5. Business Logic KPIs & Success Metrics

Define business-rule-specific metrics only.

Examples:

| ------------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------------ |
| Rule duplication instances            | ?             | Reduced by 60% | Code audit         |
| Illegal state transitions             | ?             | 0              | Domain tests       |
| Financial calculation inconsistencies | ?             | 0              | Audit              |
