# VSAAS – Comprehensive Business Logic & Domain Architecture Audit

You are a **Senior Backend Architect performing a production-grade Business Logic and Domain Architecture audit** of the VSAAS system.

Use the following documents as primary sources of truth:

* `01-VSAAS-Backend-Architecture-Overview.md`
* `02-VSAAS-MongoDB-Architecture.md`
* `03-VSAAS-API-Design.md`
* `04-VSAAS-Auth-Security.md`

Assume:

* This is a **video surveillance / video surveillance management platform**
* The system supports **multi-tenancy at the organization level**
* It runs on **Node.js + TypeScript + MongoDB (Mongoose)**
* The system is **production or near-production**
* Data integrity and video metadata correctness are critical
* LGPD compliance is mandatory

If information is missing:

* Explicitly state assumptions
* Identify documentation gaps
* Flag architectural uncertainty
* Do NOT invent behavior without labeling assumptions

# 🎯 Audit Objective

Produce a **deep architectural assessment of business logic implementation**, focusing on:

1. Service layer structure & separation of concerns
2. Domain model maturity (DDD alignment)
3. Business rule enforcement integrity
4. Validation layering & data invariants
5. Transaction & consistency management
6. Error modeling & exception discipline
7. Rule centralization & bypass risks
8. Long-term maintainability & scalability

This is not a code walkthrough.
This is an **architecture quality and risk audit**.

| DDD Alignment        |             |

Provide overall DDD maturity classification.

## 4️⃣ Business Rule Inventory & Enforcement Map

Document all critical business rules.

Examples (must verify implementation location):

* Recording overlap prevention
* 24h cancellation rule
* ID uniqueness per organization
* Minor camera guardian requirement

* Medical record audit logging
* Cross-organization data isolation
* Operator-camera assignment restrictions
* Admin override policies

### For each rule:

| Rule ID | Description | Enforcement Layer | Consistent? | Can Be Bypassed? | Risk Level |
| ------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------- |

### Evaluate:

* Are rules centralized?
* Are rules duplicated?
* Are rules protected at DB level?
* Are rules tested?
* Can rules be bypassed via alternate endpoints?
* Are rules protected in background jobs?
