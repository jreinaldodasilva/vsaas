# VSAAS – Code Quality & Enterprise Engineering Improvement Roadmap

**Source Document:**
`docs/backend/12-VSAAS-Code-Quality-Enterprise-Audit.md`

**Scope Restriction:** Code quality & enterprise engineering audit document only

---

## Context

You are generating a **strategic improvement roadmap strictly from the Code Quality Enterprise Audit document**.

You must:

* Use only findings, risks, technical debt, inconsistencies, and recommendations explicitly described in
  `docs/backend/12-VSAAS-Code-Quality-Enterprise-Audit.md`
* Not reference Architecture, MongoDB, API, Auth, Integrations, Performance, or Business Logic documents
* Not invent technical debt outside what is identified or clearly implied in the audit
* Not assume production issues unless described in the audit
* Clearly reference relevant audit sections for every issue

This is a **code-quality-focused roadmap**, not a full backend roadmap.

---

# Objective

Transform the code quality audit findings into:

1. Prioritized engineering risks
2. Structural refactor plan
3. Code-quality technical debt estimate
4. Phased improvement roadmap
5. Engineering maturity score
6. Executive summary for CTO-level audience

---

# 1. Code Quality Issue Extraction
