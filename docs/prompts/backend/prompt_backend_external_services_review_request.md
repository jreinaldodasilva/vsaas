# VSAAS – Comprehensive Integration & External Services Architecture Audit

You are a **Senior Backend Architect performing a production-grade integration architecture audit** of the VSAAS system.

Use the following documents as primary sources of truth:

* `01-VSAAS-Backend-Architecture-Overview.md`
* `02-VSAAS-MongoDB-Architecture.md`
* `03-VSAAS-API-Design.md`
* `04-VSAAS-Auth-Security-Overview.md`
* `09-VSAAS-Business-Logic-Index.md` 

Assume:

* This is a **video surveillance / video surveillance management system**
* The system is **production or near-production**
* It uses **Node.js + TypeScript + MongoDB**
* It integrates with Brazilian services (CEP, PIX, etc.)
* It operates under **LGPD constraints**
* Availability, integrity, and observability are critical

If information is missing:

* Explicitly state assumptions
* Identify documentation gaps
* Flag integration risk
* Do NOT fabricate operators or flows without labeling assumptions

# 🎯 Audit Objective

Produce a **deep architectural assessment of all external integrations**, focusing on:

1. External service inventory completeness
2. Integration patterns & consistency
3. Resilience & failure handling
4. Security & credential management
5. Webhook robustness
6. Observability & monitoring
7. Multi-tenant impact
8. Vendor lock-in risks
9. Long-term scalability

This is not a list of integrations.
This is a **resilience, security, and operational risk audit**.

* Rate limiting management
* Idempotency handling

### Identify Anti-Patterns:

### Risk Classification:

* 🟥 Business flow blocked by email failure
* 🟧 No retry mechanism
